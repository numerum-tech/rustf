# Getting Started with RustF

Welcome to RustF! This guide will help you get up and running with the framework in minutes.

## What You'll Learn

In this section, you'll learn:

1. How to install RustF and its dependencies
2. How to create your first "Hello World" application
3. How to understand the project structure
4. Basic development workflow

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Rust 1.70+** installed ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))
- **Cargo** (comes with Rust)
- Basic familiarity with Rust syntax
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code, RustRover, etc.)

## Quick Start (3 Steps)

The fastest way to get started:

```bash
# 1. Create a new project using the CLI
rustf-cli new project my-app
