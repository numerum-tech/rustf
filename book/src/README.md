## Welcome to RustF

RustF is a convention-based MVC web framework for Rust, inspired by [Total.js](https://www.totaljs.com/) v4. Designed to be equally intuitive for human developers and AI coding assistants, with auto-discovery, predictable patterns, comprehensive documentation, enterprise-grade security, and optimized performance.

### What is RustF?

RustF provides a complete web development stack for Rust applications:

- **Convention Over Configuration** - Sensible defaults reduce boilerplate
- **AI-Friendly Development** - Predictable patterns and comprehensive documentation
- **Total.js Inspiration** - Familiar patterns for web developers
- **Type Safety** - Compile-time validation throughout the stack
- **Auto-Discovery** - Automatic component registration at build time
- **Schema-Driven** - YAML schemas drive model generation and database tools

### Key Features

✅ **Auto-Discovery System** - Automatic registration of controllers, models, middleware  
✅ **Convention-Based Architecture** - Predictable project structure and patterns  
✅ **Comprehensive CLI Tools** - Project scaffolding, schema management, database tools  
✅ **Template Engine** - Total.js-style template system with layouts and partials  
✅ **Advanced Session Management** - Memory, Redis, and database storage backends  
✅ **Built-in Security Features** - CORS, CSRF protection, secure headers  
✅ **Database Tools** - Multi-database query builder with schema management  
✅ **Performance Optimized** - Request pooling, caching, and memory safety  

## Quick Start

Get started with RustF in just 3 commands:

```bash
# Using the CLI tool (recommended)
