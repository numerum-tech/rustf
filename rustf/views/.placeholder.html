<!-- 
    Placeholder for embedded views compilation
    
    This file exists to allow the embedded-views feature to compile in the framework.
    When using RustF in your application, place your actual templates in your 
    application's views/ folder as configured in views.directory setting.
    
    The embedded view engine will use the templates from your application's 
    views folder when your application is compiled.
